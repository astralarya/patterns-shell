**patterns-shell** - Design patterns for shell scripts


## Installation

You can manually copy this repository, but it is better to clone it via `git` with

>git clone https://github.com/resultsreturned/patterns-shell.git

Then you can easily get updates with

>git pull


## Patterns

### Scripts
* *autoscreen* - auto start a GNU screen session without inception
* *pgdb* - manage PostgreSQL databases
* *remote* - manage connections to remotes via SSH and SCP
* *untar* - untar and unzip archives

### Templates

You can use templates to generate custom functions.  Several scripts include
template-\* functions.  These functions take arguments and generate shell scripts
based of templates. You can save this output, analyze it, and source it, or you
can source it directly with process substitution:

>source &lt;(template-\* arg1 arg2 ... argn)

All generated functions are self documenting.  You can view this documentation with

>funcname -h

The template functions are described below:

#### pgdb
##### template-db
Generate function to access a database  
  * $1 database name
  * $2 database user
  * $3 database function name (default $1)

This template generates one function
  * dbfuncname [OPTION] [queryfile]  
    If a file is given as an argument, execute the queries in the file,  
    otherwise start a psql session connected to database.
    * -t time query or session
    * -h show help  

ex.  
>source &lt;(template-db "mydb" "myuser" "myfunc")  
Creates the function  
>myfunc [OPTION] [queryfile]  

That will perform operations on mydb as myuser

##### template-dbbackup
Generate a function to backup a database
  * $1 database name
  * $2 database superuser
  * $3 backup directory (absolute path, no trailing slash)
  * $4 generated function name (default ${1}backup)

This template generates one function
  * dbbackupfunc [OPTION] [file]  
    Backup or restore $MYDB.  
    If no arguments given, make dated backup in $3  
    otherwise, execute according the options below.  
    * -b backup database to file
    * -r restore datase from file

ex.
>source &lt;(template-dbbackup "mydb" "mysuperuser" "mybackupdir" "myfunc")  
Creates the function  
>myfunc [OPTION] [file]

That will backup and restore mydb as mysuperuser, using mybackupdir as  
the default destination for dated backups


#### remote
#####template-remote
Generate functions to connect to a server via SSH, and push/pull files via SCP
* $1 connection function name, as well as the base for the \*-push/pull functions
* $2 SSH/SCP server address
* $3 remote username
* $4 remote directory for SCP push/pull

There are three functions generated by this template
  * connection [OPTION] [command]  
    If a command is given, execute it remotely,  
    otherwise start an SSH session
    * -h show help
    * -X enable X11 forwarding
  * connection-push [file]  
    Push file to remote directory on server
  * connection-pull [file]  
    Pull file from remote directory on server

ex.
>source &lt;(template-remote "myconnection" "myserver" "myuser" "myscpdir")  
Creates the functions  
>myconnection [OPTION] [command]  
>myconnection-push [file]  
>myconnection-pull [file]  

That will connect to myserver as myuser, and push/pull from myscpdir


#### sourcedir
##### template-sourcedir
Generate statements to source all files in a directory
* $1 directory to source

NOTE: this template function does not behave correctly in process substitution
Save the output to a file and source that instead
